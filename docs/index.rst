Welcome to glosario's documentation!
===========================================================

This python package enables programatic access to the `glosario <https://github.com/carpentries/glosario>`_ glossary of technical terms. These definitions are used in the context of Carpentries lessons, where newly introduced terms require clarification. The glossary is stored in a `single large YAML file <https://github.com/carpentries/glosario/blob/master/glossary.yml>`_ that is updated by contributors and authors of lessons.
